# rus-lat-translit
Simple class for translitiration from russian letters to latin

This clas have only one method translitPhrase($phrase).
It resives string, and return sting too. 

This is not security, so you shouldn't use it for transliting users text.
I used it only for translit fake data in Symfony 4 projects.
